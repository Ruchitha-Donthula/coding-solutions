# Move All Zeroes to End

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array **arr[]** of non-negative integers, move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Perform the operation in place, without using an extra array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: The three zeros are moved to the end while the order of the non-zero elements remains unchanged.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
```

```cs
class Solution {
    public void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0;i<arr.Length;i++)
                {

                    if(arr[i]==0)
                    {
                        int j=i+1;
                        while(j<arr.Length)
                        {
                            if(arr[j]!=0)
                            {
                                var temp=arr[i];
                                arr[i]=arr[j];
                                arr[j]=temp;
                                
                                break;
                            }
                            j++;
                            if(j>=arr.Length)
                            {
                                return;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
        
    }
}
