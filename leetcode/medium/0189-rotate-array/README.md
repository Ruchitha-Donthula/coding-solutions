# Rotate Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
- 0 <= k <= 105

 

 **Follow up:** 

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

```cs
public class Solution {
    public void Rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Brute Force
        int[] arr=new int[nums.Length];
        int j=0;
        for(int i=nums.Length-k;i<nums.Length;i++)
        {
            arr[j]=nums[i];
            j++;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<nums.Length-k;i++)
        {
            arr[j]=nums[i];
            j++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<nums.Length;i++)
        {
            nums[i]=arr[i];
        }
        //best Approach
        
    }
}
```
